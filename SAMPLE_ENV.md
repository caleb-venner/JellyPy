# SAMPLE_ENV

The Python script expects the following environment variables if you choose to configure credentials in the plugin or via environment:

- SONARR_APIKEY
- SONARR_URL (e.g. http://sonarr:8989)
- RADARR_APIKEY
- RADARR_URL (e.g. http://radarr:7878)

If you prefer not to store credentials in the plugin configuration you can set them in your environment or container runtime instead.
