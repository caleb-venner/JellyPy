# Feature Implementation Summary
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Task:** Implement 5 New Configuration Toggles + Cleanup

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Implemented Business Logic for All 5 New Configuration Toggles

#### **Sonarr Features (3 toggles)**

##### 1.1 UnmonitorWatchedEpisodes ‚úÖ
- **File:** `ArrIntegrationService.cs` (lines 131-148)
- **Logic:** Conditionally unmonitors episodes after watching
- **Behavior:**
  - When `true` (default): Unmonitors watched episodes
  - When `false`: Keeps episodes monitored (useful for quality upgrades)
- **Logging:** Debug messages indicate whether episode is being unmonitored or kept monitored

##### 1.2 MonitorOnlyCurrentSeason ‚úÖ
- **File:** `ArrIntegrationService.cs` (lines 171-180)
- **Logic:** Filters next episodes to only include current season
- **Behavior:**
  - When `true`: Only monitors episodes in the same season being watched
  - When `false` (default): Monitors episodes across all future seasons
- **Implementation:** Uses LINQ `.Where()` filter on episode season number
- **Logging:** Logs when filtering is active and which season is being monitored

##### 1.3 MinimumEpisodeBuffer ‚úÖ
- **File:** `ArrIntegrationService.cs` (lines 150-167)
- **Logic:** Dynamically adjusts episode buffer based on unwatched count
- **Behavior:**
  - Counts unwatched episodes (episodes without files)
  - If unwatched count < minimum, increases buffer accordingly
  - Example: If you have 1 unwatched episode and minimum is 2, buffer increases
- **Default:** 2 episodes minimum
- **Logging:** Reports original buffer, adjusted buffer, unwatched count, and minimum setting

#### **Radarr Features (2 toggles)**

##### 1.4 UnmonitorOnlyIfWatched ‚úÖ
- **Files:**
  - `PlaybackStopHandler.cs` (lines 119-129) - Calculates watch percentage
  - `ArrIntegrationService.cs` (lines 307-325) - Checks percentage threshold
- **Logic:** Only unmonitors movies if watch percentage exceeds threshold
- **Behavior:**
  - Requires `PlaybackStop` event to capture watch percentage
  - Compares `PlaybackPositionTicks` to `RunTimeTicks` to calculate percentage
  - If percentage < `MinimumWatchPercentage`, keeps movie monitored
  - If percentage >= threshold, proceeds with unmonitoring
- **Default:** 90% minimum watch percentage
- **Logging:** Logs watch percentage and decision to unmonitor or keep monitored

##### 1.5 UnmonitorAfterUpgrade ‚úÖ
- **Files:**
  - `IRadarrService.cs` - Added `GetMovieDetailsAsync()` method
  - `RadarrService.cs` (lines 108-145) - Implements API call to get movie details
  - `RadarrModels.cs` (lines 56-150) - Added 5 new model classes
  - `ArrIntegrationService.cs` (lines 365-383) - Checks quality cutoff
- **Logic:** Only unmonitors movies that have reached their quality cutoff
- **Behavior:**
  - Queries Radarr API for movie file details
  - Checks `qualityCutoffNotMet` property from movie file
  - If cutoff not met (movie can still be upgraded), keeps monitored
  - If cutoff met (movie at target quality), proceeds with unmonitoring
- **New Models Created:**
  - `RadarrMovieDetails` - Full movie info including quality profile
  - `RadarrMovieFile` - File information with quality data
  - `RadarrQuality` - Quality wrapper
  - `RadarrQualityDefinition` - Quality details
  - Property `HasReachedQualityCutoff` - Computed property for easy checking
- **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/v3/movie/{movieId}`
- **Logging:** Reports quality cutoff status and decision

### 2. Enhanced PlaybackStopHandler for Radarr Integration ‚úÖ

#### Changes Made:
- **Added Dependency:** `IArrIntegrationService` injected into constructor
- **New Method:** `CalculateWatchPercentage()` - Computes percentage from ticks
- **Updated HandleAsync():** Now processes movies on playback stop
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. Validate event can be handled
  2. Extract event data
  3. If movie: Calculate watch percentage ‚Üí Call `ProcessPlaybackStopAsync()`
  4. Execute custom scripts as before

#### Interface Updates:
- **File:** `IArrIntegrationService.cs`
- **New Method:** `Task ProcessPlaybackStopAsync(Movie movie, double watchPercentage)`
- **Purpose:** Allows percentage-based and quality-based movie unmonitoring

### 3. Removed Legacy File ‚úÖ

- **Action:** Moved `Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy/download.py` ‚Üí `examples/legacy_download.py`
- **Reason:** Legacy Python script no longer referenced, kept for historical reference
- **Command:** `mv Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy/download.py examples/legacy_download.py`

## üéØ Feature Behavior Details

### Sonarr Episode Processing Flow

```
1. User watches S01E02
2. Plugin receives PlaybackStart event
3. ProcessEpisodeAsync() is called:

   a. UnmonitorWatchedEpisodes check:
      - If true: Unmonitor S01E02
      - If false: Keep S01E02 monitored

   b. MinimumEpisodeBuffer calculation:
      - Count unwatched episodes remaining
      - If count < MinimumEpisodeBuffer: Increase buffer
      - Example: 1 unwatched + 2 minimum = buffer increases

   c. MonitorOnlyCurrentSeason filter:
      - If true: Only get episodes from Season 1
      - If false: Get episodes from all future seasons

   d. Monitor next N episodes:
      - Apply SkipEpisodesWithFiles filter
      - Monitor episodes
      - Trigger searches if AutoSearchEpisodes enabled
```

### Radarr Movie Processing Flow

```
PlaybackStart (existing):
1. User starts watching a movie
2. ProcessMovieAsync() immediately unmonitors (if configured)
3. Simple unmonitoring without percentage check

PlaybackStop (new):
1. User finishes/stops watching a movie
2. CalculateWatchPercentage() computes completion
3. ProcessPlaybackStopAsync() is called:

   a. UnmonitorOnlyIfWatched check:
      - If enabled: Check watchPercentage >= MinimumWatchPercentage
      - If percentage too low: Keep monitored and exit
      - If percentage high enough: Continue

   b. UnmonitorAfterUpgrade check:
      - If enabled: Query Radarr for movie details
      - Check HasReachedQualityCutoff property
      - If cutoff not met: Keep monitored for upgrades
      - If cutoff met: Continue

   c. Unmonitor the movie if all checks pass
```

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Sonarr Testing:

1. **UnmonitorWatchedEpisodes:**
   - Test with toggle ON: Verify watched episode becomes unmonitored
   - Test with toggle OFF: Verify watched episode stays monitored

2. **MonitorOnlyCurrentSeason:**
   - Watch S01E05, verify only S01E06+ gets monitored (not S02E01+)
   - Watch S02E05, verify only S02E06+ gets monitored
   - Test season boundary (last episode of season)

3. **MinimumEpisodeBuffer:**
   - Set minimum to 3, buffer to 5, ensure at least 3 unwatched are always queued
   - Test with series near the end (fewer than buffer episodes remaining)
   - Verify log messages show buffer adjustment

### Radarr Testing:

1. **UnmonitorOnlyIfWatched:**
   - Set MinimumWatchPercentage to 90%
   - Stop movie at 50%: Should stay monitored
   - Stop movie at 95%: Should unmonitor
   - Check logs for percentage calculation

2. **UnmonitorAfterUpgrade:**
   - Test with movie below quality cutoff: Should stay monitored
   - Test with movie at quality cutoff: Should unmonitor
   - Requires Radarr quality profile configuration

### Integration Testing:

1. Verify UI checkboxes save/load correctly
2. Test with both Sonarr and Radarr disabled
3. Test with API keys invalid/missing
4. Test with network errors (Sonarr/Radarr unavailable)
