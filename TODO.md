# TODO

## Improve

- Create new execution parameter --> Which users trigger execution; IUserManager?
- Execution Conditions --> Field; Change to drop down selection.
- Have ALL sections in all 3 tabs collapsed by default
- Maybe put a tip/prompt/hint to expand
- ConfigPage is huge; Possible to break up files (jellyfin dependant)
- Vague naming in ConfigPage sections; 'Execution Settings' in Global tab --> doesn't align
- Global Settings probably doesn't need collapsable sections
  - Otherwise, reduce sections;
    - 'Paths' have  Interpreters and Script Directory;
    - 'Scripts' Grouping and Limits;
    - 'General' verbose logging and future settings.
- Script Settings --> Data Attributes; Currently 'Event data will be passed as JSON.'
  - Can make it clearer. 'All available Event Data will be passed as JSON.
