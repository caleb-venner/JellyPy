# JellyPy ‚Äî Jellyfin plugin for running Python scripts on events

A powerful Jellyfin plugin that runs external scripts on various Jellyfin events with advanced configuration options.

This repository contains a C# plugin (Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy) that can execute custom scripts in response to Jellyfin events like playback start/stop, item added/updated, and user management events.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ **Advanced Script Configuration**
- **Multi-Event Support**: React to PlaybackStart, PlaybackStop, ItemAdded, UserCreated, and more
- **Conditional Execution**: Set conditions based on event data (content type, user, device, etc.)
- **Custom Data Attributes**: Choose which event data to pass to your scripts
- **Multiple Executor Support**: Python, PowerShell, Bash, Node.js, and binary execution
- **Flexible Data Formats**: Pass data as command arguments, environment variables, or JSON

### üîß **Legacy Compatibility**
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing simple script configurations continue to work
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Use both legacy and advanced settings simultaneously
- **Migration Path**: Easy upgrade from simple to advanced configurations

### üåê **Enhanced Web UI**
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate configuration sections for different features
- **Visual Script Builder**: Create complex script configurations through the web interface
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on configuration validity
- **Export/Import**: Save and share script configurations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Build and Install

```bash
# Build the plugin
dotnet build Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy.sln

# Copy to Jellyfin plugins directory
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy
sudo cp Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy/bin/Debug/net8.0/Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy.dll /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/Jellyfin.Plugin.Jellypy/
```

### 2. Configure Scripts

1. Restart Jellyfin
2. Go to Admin ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí JellyPy
3. Choose your configuration approach:
   - **Legacy Settings**: Simple Python script configuration (backward compatible)
   - **Advanced Script Settings**: Full-featured script configuration system
   - **Global Settings**: System-wide execution parameters

### 3. Create Your Scripts

The plugin can execute any type of script or binary. Here's a simple Python example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import sys
import json

# Access event data through environment variables
event_type = os.getenv('EVENT_TYPE')
user_name = os.getenv('USER_NAME')
item_name = os.getenv('ITEM_NAME')
item_type = os.getenv('ITEM_TYPE')

# Or through command line arguments
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    event_data = json.loads(sys.argv[1])
    print(f"Processing {event_data['EventType']} for {event_data['ItemName']}")

# Your automation logic here
print(f"User {user_name} triggered {event_type} on {item_type}: {item_name}")
```

## üìã Configuration Guide

### Legacy Configuration (Simple)

Perfect for basic use cases:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Python Executable Path | Path to Python interpreter | `/usr/bin/python3` |
| Script Path | Path to your script | `/config/scripts/notify.py` |
| Working Directory | Script working directory | `/config/scripts` |
| Additional Arguments | Extra command line args | `--verbose --format json` |
| Timeout | Script execution timeout | `300` |

### Advanced Script Settings

Create multiple script configurations with specific triggers and conditions:

#### üé¨ **Example: Movie Download Notifier**
```json
{
  "Name": "Movie Download Notifier",
  "Description": "Notify when movies are played for the first time",
  "Enabled": true,
  "Triggers": ["PlaybackStart"],
  "Conditions": [
    {
      "Field": "ItemType",
      "Operator": "Equals",
      "Value": "Movie"
    }
  ],
  "Execution": {
    "ExecutorType": "Python",
    "ExecutablePath": "/usr/bin/python3",
    "ScriptPath": "/scripts/movie-notify.py",
    "TimeoutSeconds": 60
  },
  "DataAttributes": [
    {
      "Name": "movie-title",
      "SourceField": "ItemName",
      "Format": "Argument"
    },
    {
      "Name": "USER_NAME",
      "SourceField": "UserName",
      "Format": "Environment"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### üì∫ **Example: TV Show Episode Tracker**
```json
{
  "Name": "Episode Tracker",
  "Description": "Track TV episode viewing progress",
  "Enabled": true,
  "Triggers": ["PlaybackStart", "PlaybackStop"],
  "Conditions": [
    {
      "Field": "ItemType",
      "Operator": "Equals",
      "Value": "Episode"
    }
  ],
  "Execution": {
    "ExecutorType": "NodeJs",
    "ExecutablePath": "/usr/bin/node",
    "ScriptPath": "/scripts/episode-tracker.js"
  },
  "DataAttributes": [
    {
      "Name": "series-info",
      "SourceField": "SeriesName",
      "Format": "Json"
    },
    {
      "Name": "EPISODE_NUMBER",
      "SourceField": "EpisodeNumber",
      "Format": "Environment"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üêç Python Script Examples

### Basic Event Handler
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import json
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    # Get event data from environment
    event_type = os.getenv('EVENT_TYPE', 'Unknown')
    user_name = os.getenv('USER_NAME', 'System')
    item_name = os.getenv('ITEM_NAME', 'Unknown')

    logger.info(f"Processing {event_type}: {item_name} for user {user_name}")

    # Your logic here
    if event_type == 'PlaybackStart':
        handle_playback_start(item_name, user_name)
    elif event_type == 'ItemAdded':
        handle_new_item(item_name)

def handle_playback_start(item_name, user_name):
    # Send notification, log analytics, etc.
    logger.info(f"User {user_name} started watching {item_name}")

def handle_new_item(item_name):
    # Process new media, update databases, etc.
    logger.info(f"New item added to library: {item_name}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Sonarr/Radarr Integration
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import requests
import logging

def notify_sonarr_episode_watched():
    """Mark episode as watched in Sonarr"""
    sonarr_url = os.getenv('SONARR_URL')
    sonarr_key = os.getenv('SONARR_APIKEY')
    series_name = os.getenv('SERIES_NAME')
    season = os.getenv('SEASON_NUMBER')
    episode = os.getenv('EPISODE_NUMBER')

    if not all([sonarr_url, sonarr_key, series_name, season, episode]):
        logging.warning("Missing required environment variables for Sonarr integration")
        return

    # Sonarr API integration logic here
    headers = {'X-Api-Key': sonarr_key}
    # ... implement your Sonarr logic

def notify_radarr_movie_watched():
    """Mark movie as watched in Radarr"""
    # Similar pattern for Radarr integration
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    event_type = os.getenv('EVENT_TYPE')
    item_type = os.getenv('ITEM_TYPE')

    if event_type == 'PlaybackStart':
        if item_type == 'Episode':
            notify_sonarr_episode_watched()
        elif item_type == 'Movie':
            notify_radarr_movie_watched()
```

## üîÑ Migration from Simple to Advanced

Existing simple configurations automatically work alongside new advanced settings. To migrate:

1. **Keep existing settings** - They continue to work in legacy mode
2. **Create advanced script settings** - Add new configurations for enhanced features
3. **Test both modes** - Ensure smooth operation
4. **Gradually disable legacy** - Turn off legacy mode when ready

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building
```bash
# Development build
dotnet build

# Release build
dotnet publish --configuration=Release
```

### Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Copy DLL to development Jellyfin instance
- **Log Monitoring**: Check Jellyfin logs for script execution
- **Configuration Validation**: Use web interface to validate settings

## üìÑ License

This project is licensed under the terms in `LICENSE`.
# So you want to make a Jellyfin plugin

Awesome! This guide is for you. Jellyfin plugins are written using the dotnet standard framework. What that means is you can write them in any language that implements the CLI or the DLI and can compile to net8.0. The examples on this page are in C# because that is what most of Jellyfin is written in, but F#, Visual Basic, and IronPython should all be compatible once compiled.

## 0. Things you need to get started

- [Dotnet SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

- An editor of your choice. Some free choices are:

   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

   [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)

   [Mono Develop](https://www.monodevelop.com)

## 0.5. Quickstarts

We have a number of quickstart options available to speed you along the way.

- [Download the Example Plugin Project](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-template/tree/master/Jellyfin.Plugin.Template) from this repository, open it in your IDE and go to [step 3](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-template#3-customize-plugin-information)

- Install our dotnet template by [downloading the dotnet-template/content folder from this repo](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-template/tree/master/dotnet-template/content) or off of Nuget (Coming soon)

   ```
   dotnet new -i /path/to/templatefolder
   ```

- Run this command then skip to step 4

   ```
      dotnet new Jellyfin-plugin -name MyPlugin
   ```

If you'd rather start from scratch keep going on to step one. This assumes no specific editor or IDE and requires only the command line with dotnet in the path.

## 1. Initialize Your Project

Make a new dotnet standard project with the following command, it will make a directory for itself.

```
dotnet new classlib -f net8.0 -n MyJellyfinPlugin
```

Now add the Jellyfin shared libraries.

```
dotnet add package Jellyfin.Model
dotnet add package Jellyfin.Controller
```

You have an autogenerated Class1.cs file. You won't be needing this, so go ahead and delete it.

## 2. Set Up the Basics

There are a few mandatory classes you'll need for a plugin so we need to make them.

### PluginConfiguration

You can call it whatever you'd like really. This class is used to hold settings your plugin might need. We can leave it empty for now. This class should inherit from `MediaBrowser.Model.Plugins.BasePluginConfiguration`

### Plugin

This is the main class for your plugin. It will define your name, version and Id. It should inherit from `MediaBrowser.Common.Plugins.BasePlugin<PluginConfiguration>`

Note: If you called your PluginConfiguration class something different, you need to put that between the <>

### Implement Required Properties

The Plugin class needs a few properties implemented before it can work correctly.

It needs an override on ID, an override on Name, and a constructor that follows a specific model. To get started you can use the following section.

```c#
public Plugin(IApplicationPaths applicationPaths, IXmlSerializer xmlSerializer) : base(applicationPaths, xmlSerializer){}
public override string Name => throw new System.NotImplementedException();
public override Guid Id => Guid.Parse("");
```

## 3. Customize Plugin Information

You need to populate some of your plugin's information. Go ahead a put in a string of the Name you've overridden name, and generate a GUID

- **Windows Users**: you can use the Powershell command `New-Guid`, `[guid]::NewGuid()` or the Visual Studio GUID generator

- **Linux and OS X Users**: you can use the Powershell Core command `New-Guid` or this command from your shell of choice:

   ```bash
   od -x /dev/urandom | head -n1 | awk '{OFS="-"; srand($6); sub(/./,"4",$5); sub(/./,substr("89ab",1+rand()*4,1),$6); print $2$3,$4,$5,$6,$7$8$9}'
   ```

or

   ```bash
   uuidgen
   ```

- Place that guid inside the `Guid.Parse("")` quotes to define your plugin's ID.

## 4. Adding Functionality

Congratulations, you now have everything you need for a perfectly functional functionless Jellyfin plugin! You can try it out right now if you'd like by compiling it, then placing the dll you generate in a subfolder (named after your plugin for example) within the plugins folder under your Jellyfin config directory. If you want to try and hook it up to a debugger make sure you copy the generated PDB file alongside it.

Most people aren't satisfied with just having an entry in a menu for their plugin, most people want to have some functionality, so lets look at how to add it.

### 4a. Implement Interfaces

If the functionality you are trying to add is functionality related to something that Jellyfin has an interface for you're in luck. Jellyfin uses some automatic discovery and injection to allow any interfaces you implement in your plugin to be available in Jellyfin.

Here's some interfaces you could implement for common use cases:

- **IAuthenticationProvider** - Allows you to add an authentication provider that can authenticate a user based on a name and a password, but that doesn't expect to deal with local users.
- **IBaseItemComparer** - Allows you to add sorting rules for dealing with media that will show up in sort menus
- **IIntroProvider** - Allows you to play a piece of media before another piece of media (i.e. a trailer before a movie, or a network bumper before an episode of a show)
- **IItemResolver** - Allows you to define custom media types
- **ILibraryPostScanTask** - Allows you to define a task that fires after scanning a library
- **IMetadataSaver** - Allows you to define a metadata standard that Jellyfin can use to write metadata
- **IResolverIgnoreRule** - Allows you to define subpaths that are ignored by media resolvers for use with another function (i.e. you wanted to have a theme song for each tv series stored in a subfolder that could be accessed by your plugin for playback in a menu).
- **IScheduledTask** - Allows you to create a scheduled task that will appear in the scheduled task lists on the dashboard.

There are loads of other interfaces that can be used, but you'll need to poke around the API to get some info. If you're an expert on a particular interface, you should help [contribute some documentation](https://docs.jellyfin.org/general/contributing/index.html)!

### 4b. Use plugin aimed interfaces to add custom functionality

If your plugin doesn't fit perfectly neatly into a predefined interface, never fear, there are a set of interfaces and classes that allow your plugin to extend Jellyfin any which way you please. Here's a quick overview on how to use them

- **IPluginConfigurationPage** - Allows you to have a plugin config page on the dashboard. If you used one of the quickstart example projects, a premade page with some useful components to work with has been created for you! If not you can check out this guide here for how to whip one up.

 **IPluginServiceRegistrator** - Will be located by Jellyfin at server startup and allows you to add services to the DI container to allow for injection in your plugin's classes later.

- **IHostedService** - Allows you to run code as a background task that will be started at program startup and will remain in memory. See [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio#ihostedservice-interface) for more information. You can make as many of these as you need; make Jellyfin aware of them with an `IPluginServiceRegistrator`. It is wildly useful for loading configs or persisting state. **Be aware that your main plugin class (IBasePlugin) cannot also be a IHostedService.**

- **ControllerBase** - Allows you to define custom REST-API endpoints. This is the default ASP.NET Web-API controller. You can use it exactly as you would in a normal Web-API project. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

Likewise you might need to get data and services from the Jellyfin core, Jellyfin provides a number of interfaces you can add as parameters to your plugin constructor which are then made available in your project (you can see the 2 mandatory ones that are needed by the plugin system in the constructor as is).

- **IBlurayExaminer** - Allows you to examine blu-ray folders
- **IDtoService** - Allows you to create data transport objects, presumably to send to other plugins or to the core
- **ILibraryManager** - Allows you to directly access the media libraries without hopping through the API
- **ILocalizationManager** - Allows you tap into the main localization engine which governs translations, rating systems, units etc...
- **INetworkManager** - Allows you to get information about the server's networking status
- **IServerApplicationPaths** - Allows you to get the running server's paths
- **IServerConfigurationManager** - Allows you to write or read server configuration data into the application paths
- **ITaskManager** - Allows you to execute and manipulate scheduled tasks
- **IUserManager** - Allows you to retrieve user info and user library related info
- **IXmlSerializer** - Allows you to use the main xml serializer
- **IZipClient** - Allows you to use the core zip client for compressing and decompressing data

## 5. Create a Repository

- [See blog post](https://jellyfin.org/posts/plugin-updates/)

## 6. Set Up Debugging

Debugging can be set up by creating tasks which will be executed when running the plugin project. The specifics on setting up these tasks are not included as they may differ from IDE to IDE. The following list describes the general process:

- Compile the plugin in debug mode.
- Create the plugin directory if it doesn't exist.
- Copy the plugin into your server's plugin directory. The server will then execute it.
- Make sure to set the working directory of the program being debugged to the working directory of the Jellyfin Server.
- Start the server.

Some IDEs like Visual Studio Code may need the following compile flags to compile the plugin:

```shell
dotnet build Your-Plugin.sln /property:GenerateFullPaths=true /consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary
```

These flags generate the full paths for file names and **do not** generate a summary during the build process as this may lead to duplicate errors in the problem panel of your IDE.

### 6.a Set Up Debugging on Visual Studio

Visual Studio allows developers to connect to other processes and debug them, setting breakpoints and inspecting the variables of the program. We can set this up following this steps:
On this section we will explain how to set up our solution to enable debugging before the server starts.

1. Right-click on the solution, And click on Add -> Existing Project...
2. Locate Jellyfin executable in your installation folder and click on 'Open'. It is called `Jellyfin.exe`. Now The solution will have a new "Project" called Jellyfin. This is the executable, not the source code of Jellyfin.
3. Right-click on this new project and click on 'Set up as Startup Project'
4. Right-click on this new project and click on 'Properties'
5. Make sure that the 'Attach' parameter is set to 'No'

From now on, everytime you click on start from Visual Studio, it will start Jellyfin attached to the debugger!

The only thing left to do is to compile the project as it is specified a few lines above and you are done.

### 6.b Automate the Setup on Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code allows developers to automate the process of starting all necessary dependencies to start debugging the plugin. This guide assumes the reader is familiar with the [documentation on debugging in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) and has read the documentation in this file. It is assumed that the Jellyfin Server has already been compiled once. However, should one desire to automatically compile the server before the start of the debugging session, this can be easily implemented, but is not further discussed here.

A full example, which aims to be portable may be found in this repo's `.vscode` folder.

This example expects you to clone `jellyfin`, `jellyfin-web` and `jellyfin-plugin-template` under the same parent directory, though you can customize this in `settings.json`

1. Create a `settings.json` file inside your `.vscode` folder, to specify common options specific to your local setup.
   ```jsonc
    {
        // jellyfinDir : The directory of the cloned jellyfin server project
        // This needs to be built once before it can be used
        "jellyfinDir"     : "${workspaceFolder}/../jellyfin/Jellyfin.Server",
        // jellyfinWebDir : The directory of the cloned jellyfin-web project
        // This needs to be built once before it can be used
        "jellyfinWebDir"  : "${workspaceFolder}/../jellyfin-web",
        // jellyfinDataDir : the root data directory for a running jellyfin instance
        // This is where jellyfin stores its configs, plugins, metadata etc
        // This is platform specific by default, but on Windows defaults to
        // ${env:LOCALAPPDATA}/jellyfin
        "jellyfinDataDir" : "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}/jellyfin",
        // The name of the plugin
        "pluginName" : "Jellyfin.Plugin.Template",
    }
   ```

1. To automate the launch process, create a new `launch.json` file for C# projects inside the `.vscode` folder. The example below shows only the relevant parts of the file. Adjustments to your specific setup and operating system may be required.

   ```jsonc
    {
        // Paths and plugin names are configured in settings.json
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "coreclr",
                "name": "Launch",
                "request": "launch",
                "preLaunchTask": "build-and-copy",
                "program": "${config:jellyfinDir}/bin/Debug/net8.0/jellyfin.dll",
                "args": [
                //"--nowebclient"
                "--webdir",
                "${config:jellyfinWebDir}/dist/"
                ],
                "cwd": "${config:jellyfinDir}",
            }
        ]
    }

   ```

   The `request` type is specified as `launch`, as this `launch.json` file will start the Jellyfin Server process. The `preLaunchTask` defines a task that will run before the Jellyfin Server starts. More on this later. It is important to set the `program` path to the Jellyin Server program and set the current working directory (`cwd`) to the working directory of the Jellyfin Server.
   The `args` option allows to specify arguments to be passed to the server, e.g. whether Jellyfin should start with the web-client or without it.

2. Create a `tasks.json` file inside your `.vscode` folder and specify a `build-and-copy` task that will run in `sequence` order. This tasks depends on multiple other tasks and all of those other tasks can be defined as simple `shell` tasks that run commands like the `cp` command to copy a file. The sequence to run those tasks in is given below. Please note that it might be necessary to adjust the examples for your specific setup and operating system.

   The full file is shown here - Specific sections will be discussed in depth
    ```jsonc
    {
        // Paths and plugin name are configured in settings.json
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "tasks": [
            {
            // A chain task - build the plugin, then copy it to your
            // jellyfin server's plugin directory
            "label": "build-and-copy",
            "dependsOrder": "sequence",
            "dependsOn": ["build", "make-plugin-dir", "copy-dll"]
            },
            {
            // Build the plugin
            "label": "build",
            "command": "dotnet",
            "type": "shell",
            "args": [
                "publish",
                "${workspaceFolder}/${config:pluginName}.sln",
                "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
                "/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary"
            ],
            "group": "build",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "silent"
            },
            "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
            },
            {
                // Ensure the plugin directory exists before trying to use it
                "label": "make-plugin-dir",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "mkdir",
                "args": [
                "-Force",
                "-Path",
                "${config:jellyfinDataDir}/plugins/${config:pluginName}/"
                ]
            },
            {
                // Copy the plugin dll to the jellyfin plugin install path
                // This command copies every .dll from the build directory to the plugin dir
                // Usually, you probablly only need ${config:pluginName}.dll
                // But some plugins may bundle extra requirements
                "label": "copy-dll",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "cp",
                "args": [
                "./${config:pluginName}/bin/Debug/net8.0/publish/*",
                "${config:jellyfinDataDir}/plugins/${config:pluginName}/"
                ]

            },
        ]
    }

    ```
    1.  The "build-and-copy" task which triggers all of the other tasks
    ```jsonc
        {
        // A chain task - build the plugin, then copy it to your
        // jellyfin server's plugin directory
        "label": "build-and-copy",
        "dependsOrder": "sequence",
        "dependsOn": ["build", "make-plugin-dir", "copy-dll"]
        },
    ```
    2.  A build task. This task builds the plugin without generating summary, but with full paths for file names enabled.

        ```jsonc
            {
            // Build the plugin
            "label": "build",
            "command": "dotnet",
            "type": "shell",
            "args": [
                "publish",
                "${workspaceFolder}/${config:pluginName}.sln",
                "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
                "/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary"
            ],
            "group": "build",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "silent"
            },
            "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
            },
        ```

    3.  A tasks which creates the necessary plugin directory and a sub-folder for the specific plugin. The plugin directory is located below the [data directory](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/configuration.html) of the Jellyfin Server. As an example, the following path can be used for the bookshelf plugin: `$HOME/.local/share/jellyfin/plugins/Bookshelf/`
        ```jsonc
            {
                // Ensure the plugin directory exists before trying to use it
                "label": "make-plugin-dir",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "mkdir",
                "args": [
                "-Force",
                "-Path",
                "${config:jellyfinDataDir}/plugins/${config:pluginName}/"
                ]
            },
        ```

    4.  A tasks which copies the plugin dll which has been built in step 2.1. The file is copied into it's specific plugin directory within the server's plugin directory.

        ```jsonc
            {
                // Copy the plugin dll to the jellyfin plugin install path
                // This command copies every .dll from the build directory to the plugin dir
                // Usually, you probablly only need ${config:pluginName}.dll
                // But some plugins may bundle extra requirements
                "label": "copy-dll",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "cp",
                "args": [
                "./${config:pluginName}/bin/Debug/net8.0/publish/*",
                "${config:jellyfinDataDir}/plugins/${config:pluginName}/"
                ]
            },
        ```

## Licensing

Licensing is a complex topic. This repository features a GPLv3 license template that can be used to provide a good default license for your plugin. You may alter this if you like, but if you do a permissive license must be chosen.

Due to how plugins in Jellyfin work, when your plugin is compiled into a binary, it will link against the various Jellyfin binary NuGet packages. These packages are licensed under the GPLv3. Thus, due to the nature and restrictions of the GPL, the binary plugin you get will also be licensed under the GPLv3.

If you accept the default GPLv3 license from this template, all will be good. However if you choose a different license, please keep this fact in mind, as it might not always be obvious that an, e.g. MIT-licensed plugin would become GPLv3 when compiled.

Please note that this also means making "proprietary", source-unavailable, or otherwise "hidden" plugins for public consumption is not permitted. To build a Jellyfin plugin for distribution to others, it must be under the GPLv3 or a permissive open-source license that can be linked against the GPLv3.
